Intro-To-Data-Science
=====================

Contains work relevant to Udacity's Intro To Data Science course. 

The CodeTemplates folder contains code skeletons for each of the 
lessons in the course. Doing them will help you learn alot!   

The interesting folder is the Projects folder. In this folder you will 
find the code for the Final project. The Final project also contains a 
report in pdf, so feel free to skim that if you don't want to go through 
the code. 

There is also a folder called "4" that contains example ggplot 
code in Python.    

Enjoy!
